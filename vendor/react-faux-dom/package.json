It supports enough to work with D3 but will require you to fork and add to the project if you encounter something that's missing.\n\nYou can think of this as a bare bones [jsdom][] that's built to bridge the gap between the declarative React and the imperative JavaScript world. We just need to expand it as we go along since jsdom is a huge project that solves different problems.\n\nI'm trying to keep it light so as not to slow down your render function. I want efficient, declarative and stateless code, but I don't want to throw away previous tools to get there.\n\n## Limitations\n\nIt's great for...\n\n * Static D3 components or other such libraries (things like Backbone should work too!)\n * D3 components with simple state and event interaction, like tooltips on charts\n * D3 components such as progress bars that can be animated using [react-motion][], for example\n\nIt's not so great for...\n\n * Physics based D3 components or anything using a lot of DOM mutation and state\n * Linked to the previous one, brushing and filtering of selections using the built in stateful D3 tools\n * Essentially: Anything with a lot of DOM mutation from timers, events or internal state will be hard to use\n\nIf you keep it stateless and React-ish then you'll be fine. Use tools like D3 to fluently build your charts / DOM, don't use it as an animation / physics / DOM mutation library, that doesn't work within React. See the state example linked below for a simple way to handle state, events and D3.\n\n## Usage\n\n * Full [documentation][] with current DOM API coverage\n * [An example static chart ][lab-chart] ([source][lab-chart-source])\n * [A simple example using state and events][lab-state] ([source][lab-state-source])\n * [d3-react-sparkline][], a small component I built at [Qubit][]\n\n## Development\n\n```bash\n# Fetch the dependencies\nmake bootstrap\n\n# Test\nmake test\n\n# Test continually\nmake test-watch\n```\n\n## Author\n\n[Oliver Caldwell][author-site] ([@OliverCaldwell][author-twitter])\n\n## Unlicenced\n\nFind the full [unlicense][] in the `UNLICENSE` file, but here's a snippet.\n\n>This is free and unencumbered software released into the public domain.\n>\n>Anyone is free to copy, modify, publish, use, compile, sell, or distribute this software, either in source code form or as a compiled binary, for any purpose, commercial or non-commercial, and by any means.\n\nDo what you want.
